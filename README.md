# Housing-Sales-Price-Prediction
This project is a classic competition on Kaggle, a housing price prediction project. I worked on this project but did not participate in the competition.

The code here is only for a personal project driven by interest and self-learning. I did this in the 5th semester.

*Any suggestion is welcome, I'm still learning XD*
